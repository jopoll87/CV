  <h3>Bio</h3>

  <p>In 2012 I earned my Bachelors Degree in History and Spanish Teaching. I started working at Sunset Jr. High that fall teaching History part time. In the summer of 2013 I went back to school to earn my Masters Degree. I studied at Concordia
    University, Portland and earned my Masters Degree in Curriculum and Instruction with and emphasis in History Teaching.
    In 2017 the Administration at Sunset approached me and asked if I would be interested in teaching a Coding class. I had started to learn some programming on the side but not enough to teach, but I agreed. I spent the summer of 2017 taking classed
    and researching coding curriculum. I settled on Apple’s Everyone Can Code Curriculum. I loved this plan as students would be writing actual code and not doing “Block Coding.” There was also a good progression for a 3 year coding pathway. Since
    2017 I have started teaching Swift, Python, and HTML/CSS. </p>
  <p>In 2019 I started working at Apple Station Park as a Product Zone Specialist. I have the amazing opportunity to help people find the Apple device that will allow them to create amazing things for their families or their employers. I love being
    able to geek out with the customers over Apple’s amazing devices. </p>
